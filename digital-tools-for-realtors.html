    <h1 class="blog__titles">Digital Tools I use as a Realtor</h1>
    <h2 class="blog__headings">Google Sheets</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      I like creating spreadsheets. There, I said it. Yes, it takes time out of
      my day to create these, however, spreadsheets have helped me keep my work
      and finances organized. I tried using templates offered by Excel and of
      course the internet, but I wasn‚Äôt able to find one that suited me. So I
      decided to create mine from scratch. I primarily used Excel because I‚Äôm
      familiar with the software (for the most part). I‚Äôm no expert on using
      Google Sheets or Excel, but with Google‚Äôs help, I have been able to create
      my spreadsheets with ease. So, let‚Äôs get to the part where I tell you why
      I switched to Google Sheets:
    </p>
    <section class="blog__subheadings">
    <h3>
        I can access my spreadsheets from anywhere with internet
        connection
    </h4>
    </section>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
          It‚Äôs that simple. All you need to access Google Sheets is a Google
          account and internet connection. SOMETIMES I venture into places that
          don‚Äôt have a good connection which is why I try to keep my files
          backed up onto a stick drive.
        </p>
    

      <section class="blog__subheadings">
        <h3>Easily share spreadsheets with others.</h3>
      </section>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
          When creating spreadsheets that I know my broker is going to need
          access to, I can share any spreadsheet with her. Simply click on the
          share button, enter the email address you wish to send to and toggle
          with the access permissions and send! This has been helpful to me and
          my broker especially if one of us goes on vacation.
        </p>
      

      <section class="blog__subheadings">
        <h3>It is similar to Excel.</h3>
      </section>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
          As I mentioned before, I was much more familiar with using Microsoft
          Excel. Going back and forth from Google Sheets and Excel has been easy
          for me because they are so similar. They both use the same formulas
          for making calculations, it's super helpful not having to learn or
          master a new platform.
        </p>
      


      <section class="blog__subheadings">
        <h3>Excel Spreadsheets can be imported from your computer or drive to
          Google Sheets
        </h3>
      </section>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
          Importing my spreadsheets from Excel to Google Sheets was a breeze.
          Granted, I had to play with the layout of my spreadsheet a little
          after importing, but it wasn‚Äôt a chore. I only had to resize some of
          the cells once I imported from Excel to Google Sheets. To import from
          Excel to Google Sheets:
        </p>

        <div class="blog__list--container">
        <ol class="blog__list">
          <li class="blog__list-item">Log in to your Google Account</li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">
            Click the button on the top right corner next to your name
          </li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">Scroll and click Google Sheets</li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">
            Create a New Spread sheet by clicking the colorful + button
          </li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">
            From the top left of the menu click File
          </li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">Click "Import"</li>
          <li class="blog__list-item">
            A window will pop up, search for Upload and choose the excel sheet
            you wish to import!
          </li>
          <h4>Aaaaand boom, you're done!</h4>
        </ol>
        </div>
      
    

    <h2 class="blog__headings">DropBox</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      DropBox is a file hosting service that offers cloud storage. It‚Äôs been a
      great tool to share files and images with the Realtors I work with in the
      office. When I first began as an Admin, Realtors would email their listing
      images to me and from there I would download them to my computer and begin
      editing. Those edited images would then be uploaded to the MLS. Because
      image sizes vary, sometimes those images would have to be sent to me in
      multiple emails. I also tried sending zipped folders through Gmail, but
      that didn‚Äôt work either. With DropBox, it's as easy as logging in,
      choosing which files you want to download and walah! A zipped folder with
      your chosen files is downloaded to your computer ready to be extracted for
      use. And it's accessible from anywhere! The free version of DropBox offers
      2GB of storage space and that space can fill up quickly! Rather than
      keeping images on the DropBox, I delete old files to make room for new
      listing images and such. As an admin, I relied on Realtors to upload their
      photos to the DropBox, I would then log on and download them to my work
      computer and edit those photos for uploading to the MLS, creating flyers,
      ads, etc. Plans for individuals and or your family can be found

    <h2 class="blog__headings">MileIQ</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      MileIQ has definitely made tracking mileage easier. The best way to use
      this app is to allow Location to be enabled. This way the app can track
      your drives. I update my drives at least once a week. If you forget to
      open your MileIQ app after a while, the app has a great feature that shows
      your locations on two maps shown side by side. I have to cycle through
      each trip and label them Personal or Business. With the MileIQ app you can
      create your own labels. For my business drives I have a couple labels
      created: Showing Property, Closing, Supplies, etc. The app is not free. I
      usually refrain from spending money on apps, but this one has been worth
      it to me. Also, come tax time, MileIQ creates spreadsheets automatically
      that you can send to your accountant (or yourself if you do your own
      taxes). This is one of my favorite things about MileIQ
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog__headings">MLS App</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      This should be a given. If your MLS offers an app for your phone, download
      it and become familiar with it. I will never forget the time I was showing
      property to a couple who were looking for a waterfront fishing retreat to
      call their (second) home. We had seen just about every listing there was
      to see in their price range in the area. But nothing we drove to really
      sparked their interest. While we were standing near our cars, just about
      ready to call it quits, I pulled out my phone and looked on the MLS app. I
      checked the HotSheet‚Ä¶.and there it was. It was one that had not popped up
      on the MLS before. I showed my buyers the images from my phone and they
      wanted to see it immediately. A month later, I had my first sale. üéâ
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog__headings">Google Assistant</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      Google Assistant is an app you can download on your phone. To be frank, if
      you already do things manually like: Create alarms on your phone, use the
      default calendar (or Google Calendar) to create schedules or reminders,
      appointments, etc, then maybe Google Assistant isn‚Äôt something you would
      need. However, suppose you need a more hands free option every once in a
      while: ‚ÄúOkay Google, remind me to call so-so this afternoon @ 3pm.‚Äù And
      it‚Äôs done.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog__headings">Google Calendar</h2>
    <p class="blog_paragraph">
      I have used Google Calendar and the default calendar on my IPhone. I like
      the UI Google Calendar offers. I find it to be more vibrant and easier to
      color code events and schedules. I also found a way to sync my other
      calendars to GC. As mentioned above, Google Assistant can add your verbal
      reminders to your GC hands free. Those with IPhones may not have the
      option to be completely hands-free with Google Assistant. (In short, I use
      Google Assistant because Siri does not listen to me üòÇ).
